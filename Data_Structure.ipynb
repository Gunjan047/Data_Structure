        "\n",
        "  - Key-Value Pairs:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each item within a dictionary consists of a unique key and a corresponding value. The key acts as an identifier for the value, similar to how an index identifies an element in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Uniqueness of Keys:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  Keys within a single dictionary must be unique. If you attempt to assign a new value to an existing key, the dictionary will update the value associated with that key, rather than creating a new entry.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Immutability of Keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Dictionary keys must be immutable types, such as strings, numbers (integers, floats), or tuples containing only immutable elements. This is because dictionaries use a hashing mechanism to efficiently locate values, and mutable objects cannot be reliably hashed.\n",

        " 1. Performance and Memory Efficiency (Hashing Support)\n",

By using a key to uniquely identify each value, dictionaries offer fast lookups which are essential for tasks like mapping relationships between different entities, implementing data caches, or storing configuration settings. Additionally, dictionaries provide a flexible and dynamic way to organize and manipulate data, making them handy for various programming tasks including data processing, web development, and algorithmic problem-solving. Overall, the ability to quickly access, update, and manage key-value pairs makes dictionaries a powerful tool in Python programming for representing real-world relationships and organizing data efficiently.\n",
